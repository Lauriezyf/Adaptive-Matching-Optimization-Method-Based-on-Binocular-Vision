# Adaptive Matching Optimization Method Based on Binocular Vision
Stereo matching based on OpenCV and Mac OS

Optimization for Adaptive Support-Weight algorithm. The optimize method can reduce the average running time of ASW algorithm by 20% and the average false match rate by 2.76% when the support window is unchanged, and has good robustness to illumination.

The project also provides program code and result pictures of SAD, SSD, NCC and ASW.
